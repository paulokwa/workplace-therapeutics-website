Here are a few things to know before getting a massage:

1.  **Communicate with your massage therapist** about any medical conditions you have, as well as any medications you are taking. This will help the therapist determine if there are any contraindications to massage, or if they need to adjust their technique in any way.

2.  You may want to **discuss your preferences and expectations** with your massage therapist before the massage begins. This will help the therapist tailor the massage to your needs and ensure that you are comfortable throughout the session.

3.  Most massages involve the **use of massage oil or lotion**. Be sure to let your therapist know if you have any allergies or sensitivities that they need to be aware of.

4.  You should **undress to your comfort level** for the massage. Most people undress completely for a full-body massage, but you can leave on your underwear if you prefer. The therapist will cover your body with a sheet or towel, and only uncover the area they are working on.

5.  Remember to **breathe normally and try to relax** during the massage. It's normal to feel some discomfort or pressure during the massage, but you should let the therapist know if you are in pain or feel uncomfortable at any time.

6.  **After the massage**, you may feel relaxed and calm. However, you may also feel sore or have some muscle stiffness. This is normal and should resolve on its own within a day or two. Drinking plenty of water can help flush out any toxins that were released during the massage.
