Did you know there was a difference in how you receive a massage?

Well, most people think that you need to be semi-clothed and lying down on a table slathered in essential oils. But, this is not the only way you can enjoy massage. Did you realize you can also receive a massage sitting down, fully clothed in the comfort of your workplace or office setting? Here I will explain the differences between table and chair massage as well as their benefits.

### What is chair massage & what is it good for?
Chair massage is a portable chair that can be mobile in workplaces and offices for corporate massage. It can be elevated or angled so that the massage therapist can focus on areas such as the spine, shoulders and back. It is good for clients who want a centralized focus on upper body therapy along with the comfort of being clothed in a semi-private space.

There are abundant benefits to chair massage, here are my 10 favourite:

1. Lowers anxiety and stress

It is good for clients who want to focus on full body therapies with specific needs to their muscle groups while being semi-clothed in a private environment.

All in all the benefits of chair and table massage are both the same. If you like to relax, improve your well-being and health, there’s no better way to do so, especially in the workplace.
